            <h1><strong>Does lack of parental involvement affect school dropout among Indian adolescents?</strong></h1>
        </div>
        <div class="img-content">
            <p><strong>Despite the gross enrolment ratio of Indian children, being almost 91% in grades 6-8, the
                    equivalently soaring rates of school dropout after 8th grade remains a huge concern for the
                    policymakers.</strong></p>
            <p>Researches from the developed countries and some developing countries have shown the benefits of parental
                involvement in their children's education in terms of reduced dropout rates. However, there is a stark
                absence of similar evidence in the Indian context. Our study examines whether the lack of parental
                involvement during primary schooling of Indian children eventually results in school dropout when the
                children become adolescents. We used IHDS panel data of children (8-11 years) in round-I who become
                adolescents (15-18 years) in round-II. Bivariate, multivariable and stratified analyses were performed
                using logistic regression models. The findings from the multivariable models show that children, whose
                parents did not -participate in PTA meetings, -discuss academic progress with schoolteacher and
                -supervise their children's homework in round-I respectively had 1.15 (95% CI: 1.01-1.30), 1.14 (95% CI:
                1.01-1.29) and 1.17 (95% CI: 1.01-1.34) times higher risk of school dropout in round-II. Further, a
                similar relationship was observed when hypothesized relationship by gender, type of school attended and
                type of community of the children were examined. Among male children, parents' non-participation in PTA
                meetings was associated with 1.21 (95% CI: 1.02-1.44) times greater odds of school dropout. Children
                from private schools also had a 2.17 (95% CI: 1.42-3.32) times greater risk of dropout if their parents
                did not supervise their children in homework These findings highlight the crucial role of parental
                involvement in their children’s primary education, in terms of reduced school dropout. The findings call
                for programmatic interventions that create awareness and encourage parental participation in their
                children’s schooling.</p>
            <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
            <p>With the global commitment of Education for All, India started moving towards the goal of universal
                elementary education in 1992. While initiatives like the Right to Education Act, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan,
                the Mid-day meal scheme and many more, resulted in rapid increment of primary school enrolments, the
                issue of discontinuation of schooling education had grown unacceptably in India [1]. As per National
                Education Policy (NEP) report, the gross enrolment ratio (GER) for grades 6–8 was 90.9%, while for
                grades 9–10 and 11–12 it was 79.3% and 56.5% respectively [2]. This shows the successful effort of
                bringing children under the formal education system through primary schooling. However, the increasing
                dropout rate among Indian children, especially after 8th grade, has put the long-term benefits of such
                gross enrolment into question. “No detention policy”, that ruled out grade retention upto 8th grade,
                brought down the dropout rates to half during 2014–15 from the highs of 2006–07. However, the prevalent
                rate of school dropout among adolescents is still a major cause of concern [3]. According to NFHS-4,
                3.9% of male and 3.2%, female children experience dropout due to repeated failure in school [4]. Grade
                repetition emerged as a stressful event for early adolescents [5, 6]. Repetitive failures not only
                affects the confidence but inculcates negative attitude among children which further disrupts their
                continuation to secondary schooling [6, 7]. Moreover, school dropouts are responsible for long-term
                consequences like illiteracy, unemployment, low wage, child labour, mental health issues and involvement
                in criminal activities [8–10].</p>

            <p>Besides socio-economic, household and child-related characteristics, parental participation in home and
                school is seen as an important predictor of education and development among children in both developed
                and developing countries [11, 12]. Parental involvement in child schooling indicates the role of parents
                in guiding the children in their learning process as well as dedicating time to look after the
                vicissitudes of their life and career. Existing researches have used different definitions of parental
                involvement. Joyce Epstein came with a typology of parental involvement that includes good parenting
                (providing housing, nutrition and interacting with child), communication with the school, volunteering
                in classrooms or events, teaching at home (educational choice and help in homework), decision-making
                (participation in PTA) and collaborating with the community [13]. In developed countries, research had
                shown that children at any age are benefitted from a certain amount of parental involvement [14].
                Another study found that parents who continually motivate their children for doing their best in
                whatever activities they like had helped improve achievement among children [15]. Additionally, one
                study highlighted the benefits of parental involvement, among Spanish adolescents, in terms of better
                academic achievement [16]. School composition and peer group was also considered to be a crucial
                determinant of child schooling and education after 16 years of age [11]. One study of British children
                had shown the negative impact of maternal deprivation on their educational attainment [17]. Taken
                together these studies suggest that a majority of children benefit from experiencing parental
                involvement during their elementary education.</p>
